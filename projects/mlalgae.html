                <h1> what is it?</h1>
                <p> This project studies the effectiveness of using machine learning on predicting algal blooms. Using Southern
                    California's Coastal Observing System's (SCOOS) meteorological data, I designed and developed models to predict phytoplankton concentrations
                    much before their onset.

                <h1> cool things/ what i learned</h1>
                <p> Learned all of the steps of the machine learning model process! Some of my details follow as below</p>
                <p>Data processing: Had to find datasets for coastal places and then use pandas and numpy to observe and clean the data. The biggest problem 
                    was dealing with the amount of 0/NAn concentrations, so I used XGBoost to impute missing phytoplankton concentrations for NaN and 0 values. 
                </p>
                <p>Feature Importance: Using XGBoost's feature importance method, I determined the relative importance and contribution of each of the features
                    using different subsets to retrieve the optimal subset of parameters. 
                </p>
                <p>Studied and trained XGBoost, AdaBoost, and KNN models. To optimize my model training with the right hyper-parameters, I took advantage of 
                    sklearn's GridSearchSV module to preform an exhaustive search over specified parameter values via  grid search.
                </p>
                <p>Evaluated the model with RMSE to best figure out the best model for predicting across all 3 piers between the 3 models. While the models performed regression
                    in order to be able to spit out the estimated phytoplankton concentration, I then split the concentrations into different tiers based on how much of a risk
                    they store: healthy water, warning for potential upcoming bloom, and infected. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about using python's visualization libraries, including seaborn and matplotlib! These tools were crucial for data processing and model evaluation.
